## Key Features

End-to-End MLOps Pipeline
Includes data ingestion, transformation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment â€” all modular and scalable.

Best Model Selection: Linear Regression
After experimenting with multiple algorithms, Linear Regression provided the most interpretable and stable results for predicting student math performance.

Production-Ready Deployment
Containerized using Docker and deployed on Render (free service) with Gunicorn for handling concurrent requests efficiently.

Clean Engineering Practices
Built with structured logging, custom exception handling, and reusable components for easy debugging and extension.

## Key Learnings

Designed a complete ML pipeline that can be scaled or automated for larger datasets.

Learned how Docker simplifies containerization and deployment workflows.

Deployed ML models using Render, making cloud hosting seamless and cost-effective.

Gained hands-on experience in structuring ML projects for maintainability and clarity.

Understood why Linear Regression performs best for this problem â€” due to its interpretability and efficiency in predicting continuous numerical outcomes with low variance and minimal overfitting.
